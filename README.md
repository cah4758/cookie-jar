# Dalia's Cookie Jar

Landing site and Boostrap 5 practice space (for now - will probably add more in terms of mail contacts and such). 

Dalia's Cookie Jar is the small business that my mom runs out of the house. After finding the cookie recipe on the back of a butter container, she was able to find a new space to express her creativity. She taught Kindergarten students for about 19 years before retiring to be around more for my brother and myself while we were teenagers. 

Her business is something that she enjoys a ton and it's wild seeing her work so much to bring joy to families in her area!
